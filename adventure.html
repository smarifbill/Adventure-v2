      <h1>An Adventure In The Woods</h1>

        It was a bright sunny Saturday morning. I usually ride my bicycle down
        to the lake to go for a swim but this time I decided to take a walk in
        the woods. As I walked, I listened to the sound of the birds chirping
        and watched the trees sway as the wind grew stronger. Suddenly, I heard
        a howl, I turned around, to my suprise there was a fox standing nearby.
        Shivering with fear, I didn't know what to do. I only thought of two
        options.

        <br />
        What do you think I did?
